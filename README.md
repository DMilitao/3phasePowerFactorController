# 3-phase Power Factor Controller

**📝 Overview**

This work presents the control strategies applied to an AC/DC converter with power factor regulation. The objective is to reduce the impact of harmonics normally observed in rectifier circuits. The model in the dq-frame is introduced, as well control approaches in frequency and time domain.

#

**🚀 Implemented Approaches**

1. DQ-transform
  
The system is modelled in the time domain domain. However the control strategy is developed in the dq-frame due to the facility to work with continous variables instead of sinusoidal.

2. Frequecy-domain approach (e.g., Fuzzy Logic)

Classical approaches such as PID controller.

3. Time-domain approach (e.g., Another method)
   
Modern approaches, such as state-feedback and extended state-feedback.
